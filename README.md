## How it works

Give it your resume. The job search finds the postings that fit, you pick, and it fills in and sends each job application on the company's own form.

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| **1. Reads your resume** | Turns it into a search: the titles, the skills and the places that fit you. |
| **2. Searches** | 10 million postings from 24 public sources, rebuilt every five hours, searched on your computer. |
| **3. Scores** | Reads 100 postings at a time against your resume, scores from 1 to 5 with the gaps and the reasons, and keeps 50 scored ahead of where you are reading. |
| **4. You pick** | Select the jobs you want and say yes once. |
| **5. Applies** | A real Firefox opens the company's form, fills every required field, attaches your CV and sends. |
| **6. Keeps the answer** | What each page said, with a screenshot, for every application. |

## Why AIHawk

- **The company's own form.** No LinkedIn account and no Easy Apply: it applies where the company takes applications.
- **Every posting is tried.** There is no list of sites it refuses, and a site can be taught in one Markdown file: [what has been confirmed](docs/sites.md).
- **A browser built to look like yours.** [invisible-playwright-mcp](https://github.com/feder-cr/invisible_playwright_mcp) is a real Firefox with a person's hands, in a window you can watch.
- **One command.** It installs what it needs, and everything else happens on the screen.
