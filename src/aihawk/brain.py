"""What turns a typed sentence into browser actions, and narrates while it does.

The shell was built with this slot deliberately empty and a stub in it, so that
the seam a model plugs into would be exercised rather than imagined. This module
fills the slot with the one implementation that ships:

`OpenRouterBrain` is the product: the shared agent loop, narrating each step.
A loop that returns an answer after ninety seconds of silence is a batch job;
the same loop narrating each step is something a person can watch, interrupt
and trust. The narration is not logging bolted on, it is the feature.

There used to be a second implementation here, a literal-command placeholder
that drove the browser with no model. It was removed in 0.4.0: driving the
engine by hand without a model is what the invisible_playwright library is
for, with Playwright's whole API instead of six commands. The tests never
depended on it - they bring their own stub brains - and neither should you.
