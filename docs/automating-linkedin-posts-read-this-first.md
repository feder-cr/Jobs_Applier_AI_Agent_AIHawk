# Automating LinkedIn posts: read this first

"Automate LinkedIn posts" is a search a lot of people make on their way to a
browser agent, and the honest first page for that search is not a tutorial. You
will find no walkthrough here, no prompts, no configuration and no steps, and
the absence is deliberate. What this page does instead is lay out the landscape
a searcher needs before automating anything on LinkedIn: what the platform's
own terms say, verified against the current text today; which routes LinkedIn
itself provides; what the unofficial landscape looks like and what it costs
when it goes wrong; and why this wiki, which belongs to a browser-automation
agent, chose not to publish the guide you may have arrived expecting.

## What the User Agreement actually says

LinkedIn's User Agreement carries a section numbered 8.2, the "Don'ts", a list
of things members agree not to do. Two of its clauses are the ones that matter
here, quoted from the agreement as it stands today. Members agree not to:

> "Develop, support or use software, devices, scripts, robots or any other
> means or processes (such as crawlers, browser plugins and add-ons or any
> other technology) to scrape or copy the Services"

and not to:

> "Use bots or other unauthorized automated methods to access the Services,
> add or download contacts, send or redirect messages, create, comment on,
> like, share, or re-share posts, or otherwise drive inauthentic engagement"

Read the second clause again, because it settles the question most searchers
bring. Automated posting is not a grey area the lawyers forgot: "create,
comment on, like, share, or re-share posts" names it directly. The one
load-bearing word is "unauthorized". Authorization exists, and it has a
specific shape, described in the next section; automated posting that does not
go through it is the thing the sentence prohibits.

The help center restates the same position in plainer language. LinkedIn's
page on automated activity says:

> "We don't allow the use of third-party software or browser extensions that
> scrape, modify the appearance of, or automate activity on LinkedIn's
> website."

and the account restrictions page connects it to the consequence:

> "Automated inauthentic activity violates the LinkedIn User Agreement and can
> result in temporary or permanent restriction of your account."

That is the whole legal landscape in four sentences, all of them LinkedIn's.

## The routes LinkedIn itself provides

Two exist, and for most of the demand behind this search they are the complete
answer.

**Native post scheduling.** LinkedIn ships scheduling as a platform feature,
no third party involved. The help page for member posts, checked today,
describes composing a post and picking a publish time, with the constraint
that "The time selected must be within 10 minutes to 3 months from the current
time"; a few special post types are excluded. LinkedIn Pages have their own
scheduling for Page admins, from an hour ahead to three months out. If the
need underneath "automate my posts" is actually "write now, publish later",
which it very often is, the platform already covers it, inside the terms, for
free.

**The official developer platform.** LinkedIn's API documentation describes
the access model in one sentence: "Most permissions and partner programs
require explicit approval from LinkedIn. Open Permissions are the only
permissions that are available to all developers without special approval."
The small self-service tier includes a product for posting on behalf of the
member who authorized the app, described as "Post, comment and like posts on
behalf of an authenticated member". Everything broader, the marketing and
advertising side in particular, sits behind applying to a LinkedIn partner
program and being approved. Stated at the category level, which is as far as
this page goes: an authorized route for programmatic posting exists, it runs
through LinkedIn's developer portal, and beyond one narrow self-service
product it involves LinkedIn saying yes to your application.

## Everything else, and what it costs

The unofficial landscape divides into two categories. There are scheduler and
engagement SaaS products whose LinkedIn support does not run through the
approved API, operating instead through unofficial means; and there is browser
automation in all its forms, AI agents included, driving the site the way a
person would. The clauses quoted above cover both, and the help pages say what
happens next: detection, then restriction. LinkedIn's automated-activity page
describes the recovery path for a restricted account, which involves disabling
the software before the account is re-enabled, and the restrictions page says
plainly that the outcome can be temporary or permanent.

The cost side deserves one plain sentence. A LinkedIn account is, for most
people, a professional identity built over years, which makes it about the
most expensive account there is to lose to a tool experiment.

One line acknowledging the obvious, because pretending otherwise would insult
you: tools and workflows that automate LinkedIn through the browser exist in
the wild, and this page does not name, link or describe them.

## Why this wiki does not publish a LinkedIn walkthrough

The social posting series here has per-platform pages for Facebook, Instagram
and X. LinkedIn is deliberately absent, and this page is the explanation
rather than the replacement.

An honest LinkedIn automation guide would have to open by telling you that the
platform's terms prohibit the approach it was about to teach; section 8.2
names automated post creation in as many words. Every paragraph after that
opening would be teaching what the terms prohibit, with the reader carrying
the account risk. We choose not to write that page. This is an editorial
position, not a technical limitation, and it is worth being explicit about the
conflict of interest that makes it credible: this wiki documents a
browser-automation agent, a walkthrough would have been easy traffic, and a
tool vendor teaching you to automate the most automation-restricted mainstream
platform would be marketing dressed as documentation. The pages we do publish
for other platforms open with what their terms say, too; LinkedIn is the
platform where that opening is the whole story.

If you take one thing from this page: the sanctioned routes, native scheduling
and the approved developer products, cover the legitimate demand. What they do
not cover, LinkedIn has written down that it does not want.

## Short answers to the questions that lead here

**Can I automate my LinkedIn posts?** Through LinkedIn's own routes, yes:
native scheduling covers "write now, publish later", and the developer
platform covers authorized programmatic posting. Outside those routes, the
User Agreement's 8.2 list prohibits bots and unauthorized automated methods
for creating posts, in exactly those words.

**Does LinkedIn have built-in post scheduling?** Yes, verified against the
help pages today: member posts can be scheduled from 10 minutes to 3 months
ahead, and Pages have scheduling for admins. No third-party tool is needed for
scheduling alone.

**Is there an official LinkedIn API for posting?** Yes. A narrow self-service
product allows an app to post on behalf of the member who authorized it;
broader access requires applying to LinkedIn's partner programs, and LinkedIn's
own documentation says most permissions require its explicit approval.

**Will a LinkedIn automation tool get my account restricted?** LinkedIn states
that it does not allow software or extensions that automate activity on the
site, and that automated inauthentic activity can lead to temporary or
permanent restriction. That is the platform's own description of the risk, not
this wiki's estimate.

**Why is there no AIHawk guide for posting to LinkedIn?** Because an honest
one would open by saying the terms prohibit the approach, and we choose not to
teach what the terms prohibit. The neighboring platforms have pages; this one
has this page instead.
