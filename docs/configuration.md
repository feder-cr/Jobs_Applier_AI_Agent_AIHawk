# Configuration

Press `e` in AIHawk to change these on the screen. AIHawk reads `aihawk.yaml` in its folder, `~/.aihawk` by default. A missing file, or a missing key, takes the default below. Restart `aihawk` after you edit the file.

Loading a resume rewrites this file, and the rewrite drops the comments you put in it, so keep your notes elsewhere.

## A trial that sends nothing

With the environment variable `AIHAWK_DRY_RUN` set to anything, an application stops once the form is filled and the send control is found: the job is recorded as blocked, with a screenshot, and nothing reaches the employer. Every step the model took on the page is written to `data/trace.log`, with the account password hidden; `AIHAWK_TRACE` set alone writes that file for real applications too. For trying a site or a plugin with a test CV.

## What it costs

AIHawk counts the tokens of every model call and prices them with the gateway's own list, read once per start. A sent application shows its cost in its details, and the log says what each application and each scoring cost. The shortlist model's calls are not counted: they go through another endpoint and cost under a cent per hundred postings.

## The accounts it made

A site that needs a candidate account, such as Workday, gets one made with your email and the `account_password` from your answers. Which sites have one is kept in the `accounts` table of `data/jobs.db`, by host, so the next form on that site signs in instead of registering again. Nothing asks you to sign in by hand.

## Your answers

What the forms are told about you beyond the CV (email, phone, location, links, and anything you add) lives in the `answers` table of `data/jobs.db`, the SQLite file in the AIHawk folder. Press `e`, then "Your answers", to see, change or add them; an answer you gave is kept when a new resume is read. `email` and `mail_provider` (gmail or outlook) are the mailbox AIHawk opens for you to sign in to, asked once after the resume and again from "Your mail" in Settings; a site's code can only be read from a mailbox you are signed in to. AIHawk makes an `account_password` the first time it starts and keeps it there: the one password it uses on job sites that need an account, such as Workday, so you can sign in to those sites yourself. The `answers.yaml` of earlier versions is read once, brought into the table and renamed `answers.yaml.imported`.

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | empty | Your name for this search, shown at the top of the list. |
| `goals` | empty | What you are looking for, in your own words. The decision model and the judge read it. |
| `database` | `https://github.com/feder-cr/Jobs_Applier_AI_Agent/releases/download/jobs-latest/manifest.json` | Where the job database is: the URL of its `manifest.json`, or the path of a local one. The files it names sit beside it, unless its `base_url` says otherwise. |
| `max_age_days` | `60` | Postings posted more than this many days ago are left out. A posting with no date is kept. |
| `model` | `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` | Fills the application forms. |
| `quick_model` | `google/gemini-3.5-flash` | Writes the search plan from your CV, and the other short calls of a search. |
| `judge_model` | `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` | Writes the score and the report of each shortlisted posting. |
| `decision_model` | `typesafe/jev-1.14` | Jev, which answers the six questions that shortlist the postings. |
| `filters.include` | empty | Title words to search for. With no `plan`, each word is one title. AIHawk asks for a resume until there is a CV and at least one of these. Reading a resume writes this and `plan`, and the Settings screen does not offer them: a different search comes from a different resume. |
| `filters.exclude` | empty | Whole words: a posting whose title has one of them is left out. |
| `filters.locations` | empty | Places a posting's location must name, as whole words. |
| `filters.countries` | empty | Countries. A posting in one of them passes. With `locations`, a posting that names one of those places passes only if its country is empty or one of these. |
| `filters.cities` | empty | Cities. A posting whose location names one ranks higher; others are not left out. |
| `filters.plan` | empty | The title plan, with `nodes` and `arcs`. Each node has an `id`, a `weight` and `forms`, the wordings with their weights; a node of weight 0 only conditions the arcs. Each arc has `when` or `unless` (a node or a phrase in the title) and `then`, a list of `target` and `multiplier`; the target `*` is the whole title. Empty: the plan is `filters.include`. |
