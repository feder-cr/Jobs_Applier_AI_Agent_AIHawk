# AI browser agent vs RPA: which one fits the job

RPA records a fixed sequence of clicks on one version of a screen and repeats it exactly, forever, until the screen changes. An AI browser agent reads whatever is on the page and decides what to click, which costs more per run but survives changes that would break a recorded path. Pick by volume and how often the page changes.

This wiki is maintained by the people who build [AIHawk](https://github.com/feder-cr/AIHawk); the goal is a fair split of where each approach wins, not a pitch for one side.

## What RPA actually does

RPA, robotic process automation, automates a screen the way a macro automates a spreadsheet: capture the steps once, then replay that sequence later. The vendors split the work across three parts, and UiPath's own documentation names them in one sentence: Studio is "the central development environment for building automations published to Orchestrator and executed by the Robot". You build in one place, a scheduler owns the runs and their logs, and an unattended worker does the clicking. The bots that come out are deterministic, and everything else about RPA follows from that.

## What an AI browser agent actually does

An AI browser agent is a model in a loop with a real browser: it reads the page, decides one action, the browser performs it, and it reads again. [What is an AI web agent?](ai-web-agent-explained.md) covers that loop in full. Against RPA, what matters is what the loop lacks: a recorded path. The model re-derives the sequence from the page's current state on every run.

## Determinism and audit trail vs adapting to a changed page

A recorded RPA bot does the identical thing every time, which is a strength where identical is what you want: it can show exactly what happened on a given date, because its actions were never a decision.

An agent cannot make that promise: it can take a different path on the same page twice, because deciding is what it does instead of replaying. [AI browser agents vs traditional scraping](ai-browser-agents-vs-traditional-scraping.md) makes the same case for scrapers, and it holds here too: determinism is not a property you can add to a model that decides at every step.

## What breaks each one

A moved button breaks an RPA bot outright: it was recorded against a specific element, and a redesign makes it click the wrong thing, or nothing, with no way to tell the difference itself.

An ambiguous page breaks an agent instead: two buttons with the same label, a caption read too quickly, a dialog nobody expected. These push it toward a confident wrong action rather than an error. The two tools fail on nearly opposite triggers.

## The cost shape: licence and build time vs tokens per run

RPA's cost sits up front: a platform licence, developer time to build each workflow, and a per-bot fee owed whether it runs once or a million times a month. Once built, running it again costs close to nothing.

An agent's cost sits on the other side: no licence, and a new task is a sentence of instruction, but every run spends real money on tokens. [AI browser agents vs traditional scraping](ai-browser-agents-vs-traditional-scraping.md) makes the same case against a scraper: cheap to start, not cheap to repeat at scale.

## Volume is the axis that decides most of this

Past a certain number of identical runs a day, RPA's upfront cost stops mattering; below that number, paying a developer to build and maintain a workflow costs more than the task was worth.

| | RPA (or a script) | AI browser agent |
|---|---|---|
| Decides by | Replaying a recording | Reading and deciding |
| Best fit | Thousands of runs a day | A handful of varied runs |
| Breaks on | A moved button | An ambiguous page |
| Cost shape | Licence plus build, cheap per run | No licence, real cost per run |
| Audit | Exact replay | Check the output instead |

## Where RPA is genuinely ahead: governance and approval

Enterprises adopted RPA as much for the paper trail as for the automation, and this is where an agent has nothing comparable yet: an orchestrator console showing every bot, who approved it, and a full log per run is what lets compliance sign off on a regulated process. Rebuilding that around an agent is possible but is not what any framework ships by default, ours included.

## The hybrid most teams actually ship

Most organizations split by task rather than pick one winner: the identical, high-volume path runs on RPA or a plain script, near-zero cost per run; the exception, the one-off nobody wants to build a workflow for, goes to an agent instead. [Moving data between two web apps](move-data-between-web-apps-with-an-ai-agent.md) is exactly this second case: cheap to ask for once, not worth automating if it never repeats.

Some teams go further: an agent walks a new screen once so a human can turn what it did into a maintained workflow, the same discovery-then-code pattern the [scraping comparison](ai-browser-agents-vs-traditional-scraping.md) describes for scrapers.

This does not decide which agent to run once volume has pointed you at "agent"; [choosing an AI browser agent](best-ai-browser-agent.md) covers that separately.

## Short answers to the questions that lead here

**Is an AI agent better than RPA?** Neither, by default: RPA wins at high volume with a fixed screen and a required audit trail; an agent wins on a handful of varied or one-off tasks. Ask how often the screen changes first.

**Can RPA handle a page that changes?** Not automatically: a recorded bot targets a specific screen, and a moved element makes it click the wrong thing until someone re-records the steps. An agent re-reads the page on every run instead.

**Does an AI agent replace RPA?** No: they solve differently shaped problems, one replays, one decides. Organizations that use both route the high-volume path to RPA and the exceptions to an agent.
