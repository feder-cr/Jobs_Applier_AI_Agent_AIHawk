"""A `.env` beside the command, and the order that decides who wins.

The key and the browser path are the two things nobody wants to retype, and a
shell profile is a bad home for them: it is global, invisible from the project,
and different on every machine. So a `.env` in the directory the command runs
from is read at startup.

Three properties carry the whole design, and each is a decision that could
reasonably have gone the other way:

  1. THE CURRENT DIRECTORY ONLY, never a walk upwards. `find_dotenv` searches
     parent directories, so running from a subfolder can silently pick up
     somebody else's file - a different key, a different browser - with nothing
     on screen saying which one was used.
  2. IT NEVER OVERRIDES what is already set. A variable exported in the shell is
     something the user just did; a line in a file is something they did once,
     weeks ago. So the precedence a reader can rely on is
     `--flag > environment > .env > default`.
  3. IT SAYS THE NAMES AND NEVER THE VALUES. The line exists so a reader knows
     the file was found at all; printing what was in it would put the API key on
     the terminal, and terminals get pasted into issues.
