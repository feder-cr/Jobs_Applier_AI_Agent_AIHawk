"""The package must accept an OpenRouter key and nothing else.

These tests pin the "OpenRouter only" requirement at three levels:

1. the pure resolvers in ``aihawk.llm`` (key, model) - which environment
   variables they read and which they must never read;
2. the constructed client object (base URL, api_key) under an environment
   deliberately loaded with OpenAI variables;
3. the bytes that actually leave the process - a real
   ``chat.completions.create`` against a local stub server, so the assertion is
   on the outgoing ``Authorization`` header rather than on an attribute that
   merely looks right.

Level 3 exists because level 2 is not sufficient: ``client.api_key`` can hold
the caller's key while the request carries a different one. That is exactly
what happens today, and the section "KNOWN DEFECTS" at the bottom of this file
records it with ``xfail(strict=True)`` so the suite reports the hole instead of
hiding it, and turns red the moment somebody fixes it.

No browser and no MCP server is started here; every test in this file is safe
to run at any time.
