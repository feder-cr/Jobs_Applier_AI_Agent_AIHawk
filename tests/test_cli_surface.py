"""The command line as a person meets it.

No browser and no model are involved: `Link` is replaced by a recorder that
stops the command the moment it would connect, so every test asserts what the
CLI decided and handed over, not what the browser did.

The theme of this file is the API key. `aihawk` takes an OpenRouter key and
nothing else, and a key that reaches the terminal is a key in a scrollback
buffer, a CI log and a screen recording. FAKE_KEY below carries the marker
CANARY on purpose so any echo of it, whole or truncated after the prefix, is
recognisable; test_the_key_detector_is_not_vacuous proves the detector can
actually see a leak instead of always printing PASS.

⛔ THIS FILE USED TO DRIVE `aihawk do`, WHICH NO LONGER EXISTS. The subcommand
was removed on 2026-09-03: one way in, and it is `ui`. Most of what was here
tested the option surface and the key handling, and both are still real, so
those tests moved onto `ui` rather than being deleted with the command. Four
guarantees genuinely died with it and are recorded here so nobody hunts for
them later:

  * "no key anywhere exits 1 and names both ways to supply one" - `ui` does not
    require a key at all. It starts on the literal-command placeholder instead,
    which is a deliberate difference and not a regression;
  * "the TASK argument is required", "the task reaches drive verbatim" and "the
    result is printed verbatim with one trailing newline" - `ui` takes no task
    and prints no result.
