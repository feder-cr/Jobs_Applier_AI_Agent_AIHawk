"""A real browser, a real model, and one factual question about a page.

⛔ THIS USED TO INVOKE `aihawk do`, removed on 2026-09-03. What it was actually
proving was never the subcommand: it was that the loop, given a real browser and
a real model, reads a page and answers what is on it. That is the whole product
in one assertion, and it survives the command that used to carry it.

So it now opens the same `Link` the interface opens and runs the same loop the
interface runs. What is lost with `do` is the CLI wiring around it, and that is
covered without a browser or a key in test_cli_surface.py.

Skipped unless both a real binary and a real key are present, because it spends
money and launches Firefox.
